# Get started

This guide will walk you through the steps needed to set up your Onju Voice PCB with ESPHome. You'll go through the steps of replacing the PCB in the Google Nest mini V2, installing the necessary software, and configuring the settings to get everything up and running smoothly.

## Step 1 - Install firmware

Use the method below to provide your Onju Voice PCB with the correct firmware. Please note that you can use the tabs to select which firmware version you want to install.

_Make sure this page is opened in a Chromium-based browser on a desktop. The software installation does not work with a tablet or phone._

## Step 3 - Connect to Home Assistant

There are two ways to connect the Onju Voice Satellite to Home Assistant. You can do this during the firmware installation or later via auto discovery.

### Option 1 - During firmware installation

1. Immediately after setting up your Wi-Fi network (from step 1), you will see a screen with the option **Add to Home Assistant**.
    - This opens the **My** link to Home Assistant (see image below).
      - If you have not used My Home Assistant before, you will need to configure it. If your Home Assistant URL is not accessible on `http://homeassistant.local:8123`, replace it with the URL to your Home Assistant instance.
2. Click on **Open the link**.
3. It opens your Home Assistant instance and asks you to set up, click **OK**.
4. Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully added the Onju Voice Satellite to your Home Assistant instance.

### Option 2 - Auto discovery

When the Onju Voice Satellite is added to a network to which your Home Assistant instance is also connected, your device will automatically be recognized in Home Assistant.

1. Under [**Settings** > **Devices & Services**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/), your Onju Voice Satellite should be discovered (see image below).
2. Click on **Configure**, at the discovered device.
3. It asks if you want to add the device and click **Submit**.
4. Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully added the Onju Voice Satellite to your Home Assistant instance.
